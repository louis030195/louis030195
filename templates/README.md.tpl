Louis, is a carbon-based bipedal life form descended from an üêí.

Louis is a Techstars 22 alumni, he is also a OrangeDAO.xyz f1 and buildspace.so/sf1 fellow.
Louis has previously worked for the French CIA and in the cloud industry and has been building LLM-powered products since 2019.

Louis is a generalist, both graduate and self-taught, thanks to reading 100 non-fiction books a year and a deep passion and bias-to-action for technology.

I first learned to use a computer and speak English at the age of 8, doing business on online games. I quickly owned a four figures business through bots that would earn while I was sleeping.

Early on, I had to face the harsh realities of life and was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of 13. I spent my time in hospital learning how to cheat in games through programming. I would reverse engineer games and inject Assembly/c++ code into the client code. Later on I preferred relying on network-based hacks.

This childhood experience led me to entrepreneurship, among many other adventures, driven by a deep desire to transcend human experience through technology.

Louis is currently working on a stealth startup.
