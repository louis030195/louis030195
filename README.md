          Personality Traits for entrepreneurs 

Summary:
Openness equals non-discriminatory, right? Equals every new idea is a great idea. It's hard to be creative if you're not discriminatory. Great artists are picky and choosy over what they think the great ideas are. And so maybe you want like high openness, you want high low agreeability - which means high disagreeability.

Speaker 1
It's like they're nervous system is not wired that way. And so you kind of need to close your eyes and kind of imagine, you know, what if you took somebody who was born to be a musician, for example, and you forced them to become an accountant, Right? Or vice versa, like what if you took somebody who was born to be an accountant and forced them to be a musician, right? And both people would be very, very unhappy. And so anyway, this is sort of the inherent trait of creativity, openness. So we say that, you know, that's one, you know, against the, you know, directly related one is agreeableness, right? So open plus agreeable equals every new idea is a great idea, right? Equals non-discriminatory. Well, it's hard to be creative if you're not discriminatory. Like one of the things that great artists have in common is they're like actually really picky and choosy over what they think the great ideas are and they throw away a lot of their like Initial attempts. And so maybe you want like high openness, you want high, you want actually high low agreeability, which means high disagreeability, right? So you kind of want that. Conscientiousness, you know, do artists or creators or programmers or entrepreneurs have to be conscientious? Probably yes, to some extent, right? And there's a sub-trade of conscientiousness called industriousness, which basically is like inherent work ethic, right? Sort of drive to get things done. So, you know, you probably need some of that. So, just to start with that, because, when I first heard something like consciousness, right?

          People think startups grow out of some brilliant initial idea like a plant from a seed. But almost all the founders I interviewed changed their ideas as they developed them. PayPal started out writing encryption software, Excite started as a database search company, and Flickr grew out of an online game.

          Bayesian philosophers see the conditional relationship as more basic than that of joint events - that is, more compatible with the organization of human knowledge. In this view, B serves as a pointer to a context or frame of knowledge, and A I B stands for an event A in the context specified by B (e.g. , a symptom A in the context of a disease B).Consequently, empirical knowledge invariably will be encoded in conditional probability statements, whereas belief in joint events (if it is ever needed) will be computed from those statements via the product peA, B) = peA I B) P(B), (1.9) which is equivalent to (1.8).
