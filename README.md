Hi, I'm Louis, I am a carbon-based bipedal life form descended from an 🐒.
In 2022 I [made 7000 contributions on GitHub](https://github.com/louis030195), 
[read 93 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103091881-louis-beaumont), 
and [written 1.000,000 words on a public Obsidian](https://brain.louis030195.com).
- I also founded an AI startup that became a 5 figure business in only a few months and got into in the latest [Techstars](https://techstars.com) batch.
- In 2023, I built [An AI assistant for Obsidian](https://github.com/louis030195/obsidian-ava), aligned with my desire to reduce the friction between our physical and digital mind. This was part of [Buildspace n&ws2](https://buildspace.so).
- Now building [Embedbase](https://embedbase.xyz)

          Is My To Do List Done Yet?

Summary:
It's a daily review process combined with getting into the habit of making notes as you're doing the work, which i i think has a couple of benefits. Because our memories aren't very good at keeping track of what we really do. All of us ar involved in something, hopefully that we care about, that is important to us. Ah, it's just good practiceto be able to track how you're actually spending your time and energy, or investing your time andEnergy instead of just relying on your memory to do that.

          Your instinctive willingness to believe something will change along with your willingness to afliate with people who are known for believing it—quite apart from whether the belief is actually true. Some people may be reluctant to believe that God does not exist, not because there is evidence that God does exist, but rather because they are reluctant to afliate with Richard Dawkins or those darned “strident” atheists who go around publicly saying “God does not exist.”
