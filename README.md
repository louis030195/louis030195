Hi, I'm Louis, I am a carbon-based bipedal life form descended from an üêí.
In 2022 I [made 7000 contributions on GitHub](https://github.com/louis030195), 
[read 93 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103091881-louis-beaumont), 
and [written 1.000,000 words on a public Obsidian](https://brain.louis030195.com).
- I also founded an AI startup that became a 5 figure business in only a few months and got into in the latest [Techstars](https://techstars.com) batch.
- In 2023, I built [An AI assistant for Obsidian](https://github.com/louis030195/obsidian-ava), aligned with my desire to reduce the friction between our physical and digital mind. This was part of [Buildspace n&ws2](https://buildspace.so).

          Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for. Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead of making users happy. In a startup, you‚Äôre not just trying to solve problems. You‚Äôre trying to solve problems that users care about. So I think you should make users the test, just as acquirers do. Treat a startup as an optimization problem in which performance is measured by number of users. As anyone who has tried to optimize software knows, the key is measurement. When you try to guess where your program is slow, and what would make it faster, you almost always guess wrong.

Tei it's a daily review process combined with getting into the habit of making notes as you're doing the work, which i i think has a couple of benefits. Ah, it's just good practiceto to track how you're actually spending your time and energy, or investing your time and energy, instead of just relying on your memory to do that. Because our memories aren't very good at keeping track of what we really do. I think there's there's another cognitive and em a benefit to doing this, which is all of us ar involved in something, hopefully that we care about, that's important to us.
