          You are the average of the five people around you 

Key takeaways:
- Creative success not only depends on individual effort but also on one's social network
- One becomes the average of the five people they spend the most time with

Speaker 1
Yeah, so this was my fourth topic, which you cruelly, you can cut my screen.

Speaker 3
I know I feel like we totally lost track of like, how do we country and then you just started like going depth first as opposed to like actually tackling the actual...

Speaker 2
Look, I will come back next to the next statement and biology go eight hours, okay? So I hope Mark went to the bathroom before this because we are going to meet the record like, art de yo, we will go both red and depth first. Eight hours and one minute. All right, it's been a new challenge.

Speaker 1
So, yeah, look, this is gonna be the thing I was gonna say. Like, look, there's a part of being creative that is individual effort and is individual effort to learn and is individual effort to try to actually create something. And then there's a big part of it. It's like, what is your personal social network? Like, who are your friends? And there's an old adage that is absolutely true, which is basically any individual over time, you basically become the average of the five people you spend the most time with. You know, you zero in, you adapt. And it's a fundamental human instinct because everybody, you know, very few people can go through life alone. You need some sort of support network. Your support network has a value system and they have things they care about and things they're interested in and you will tend to care about and be more interested in those things. And if they, if you don't have anybody around you who shares your interests, right, or has the same drives that you do, you'll have a very hard time sustaining it.

You are the instrument that you use to get things done in the world. There's still a tremendous amount of effort and skill that's valuable in that domaind.

Speaker 1
Like when you're trying to get yourself to do something you know you should b be doing, but somehow there's some sort of barrier that's keeping you from doing that. I think at this point i've, i've worked in enough businesses and started enough of my own businesses, the business side of things is relatively fluid. It doesn take a whole lot of mental effort or energy to keep those things in mind right now. But you are the instrument that you use to get things done in the world. And so the the debugging your own mind and help and trying to anticipate how others are thinking and feeling and trying to optimize around that, there's still a tremendous amount of Effort and skill that's valuable in that domaind and i find myself thinking about tho sorts of things quite often.
