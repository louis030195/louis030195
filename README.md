Summary:
The modern use of the word cult is, we have this very micro-deficient cult. It's like a fake new religion as compared to the all presumably real older. In the language of the ancient city, these are all cults.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah. In the language of the ancient city, these are all cults. These are all cults. The modern use of the word cult is, we have this very micro-deficient cult, which is like, whatever, basically what it's called meaning, kind of, modern parlance. It's like a fake new religion. As compared to the all presumably real older.

Speaker 2
Let me ask you a spicy question. If Mark had reason for starting a cult, what would that cult have to do and believe in? Don't you, I mean, you already have the answer.

Speaker 1
You're in it.

Speaker 3
Yeah. Yeah. Mark, I just thought you were going to say, my religion will require a sacrifice.

Speaker 1
Of course it requires a price. All religious requires a sacrifice.

Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah. Someday our daughter has to be taken away from us, like, without city. Wow.

Speaker 1
No, no, no. We have the diluted form. My version, my call is a very diluted form of what my predecessor 4000 years ago would have had.

Speaker 2
Yeah, she only has listened to Mark's podcast.

Speaker 1
But appropriately so. There we go. OK. Booktube.

Speaker 2
Booktube. The Machiavellian's by a burner. Yeah.

Speaker 1
So actually, there's two books by Burnham. I referenced the Machiavellian's is actually stronger on, it's very good on politics, political theory, political structure, political power. And I'm happy to talk about that. The other book, the managerial revolution, is actually even more relevant, I think, to the kind of world that we live in. And maybe I could touch on that one if that's OK. Yeah. Yeah.

          A Majorana fermion, also referred to as a Majorana particle, is a fermion that is its own antiparticle. They were hypothesised by Ettore Majorana in 1937. The term is sometimes used in opposition to a Dirac fermion, which describes fermions that are not their own antiparticles.
