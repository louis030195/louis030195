          Great founders thought five years or more about the problem beforehand

Summary:
The great successful companies, great founders, almost always have thought deeply about the domain they're operating in for five years or longer. And basically, you ask increasingly detailed questions. If the answers get more and more specific, as the questions get more andmore specific, that's really good. "By the way, OK, by the way, you're also trying to pull one on yourself," he adds.

You have to really understand all of the twists and turns that require getting from point A, which is like a vague idea of what you want to do, kind of all the way to point Z on the other side of the maze, which is an actual product that matters that you can build a startup around. And you have to actually think your way through all those steps. And the founders who are good at what they do, think through, they take the time they put in the effort, often years. What I find is it's almost always five years plus. This is not like a short term thing. It's almost always somebody. The great successful companies, great founders, almost always have thought deeply about the domain they're operating in for five years, up and 10 years, up and longer. And basically, you ask increasingly detailed questions. If the answers get more and more specific, as the questions get more and more specific, that's really good. If the answers get more and more in general and more and more fuzz, then it's like, OK. And by the way, OK, you're trying to pull one on us. OK, by the way, you're also trying to pull one on yourself. Yeah, right.

          Cryptocurrency Blockchain Web Three Is Following This Exact Trajectories

Key takeaways:
- Morrison derives a threestep process for how new technologies are received by the status quo.
- Stage one is just ignoring the technology, while stage two is engaging in rational counter arguments.
- Stage three is when the name calling begins, with opponents accusing the technology of being bad for society.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
And so Morrison basically derives, he goes through this example, and he derives basically this three part process that he says applies to any new technology. Basically, as it is as it is greeted and fought by the status quo by the powers it be. And he says basically, it's a three step process. The step one is just completely ignore it. Like, so just pretend it doesn't exist, refuse to acknowledge it, don't talk about it, don't even engage in conversations like we're just not going to do this. At some point though, at some point, these things become too obvious and they have to engage. She said step two is rational counter argument, right? So, and rational counter argument is this can't possibly work because, you know, it's going to be too expensive. It's not going to be fast enough. It's not going to scale. People don't know how to use it. All the different kind of rational arguments that you can come up with to oppose something. And then ultimately, when those don't work anymore, because people are still watching this and being like, okay, this still seems like a good idea. Then he says stage three is when the name calling begins. And so stage three is basically just like a full out power status political fight where all of a sudden basically it's like, okay, these are these people who are bringing this technology, they're bad people, they have bad morals, they have bad intent, they're going to ruin everything. And if you think about it, it's so funny because it's like basically the internet followed this exact trajectory. Like, you know, crypto cryptocurrency blockchain web three is following this exact same trajectory social networking follows this exact same trajectory. Like, I've now seen this pattern, you know, out of 50 times in the last 30 years and it keeps playing out the same way. Nobody learns anything. Right. And it is this is literally what happens with every new technology and I become convinced that basically how this unfolds.
