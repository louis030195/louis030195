          You are the average of the five people around you 

Summary:
"I hope Mark went to the bathroom before this because we are going to meet the record like, art de yo, we will go both red and depth first," he says. "It's a fundamental human instinct because everybody, you know, very few people can go through life alone ... You need some sort of support network." He adds: "If they, if you don't have anybody around you who shares your interests, or has the same drives that you do, you'll have a very hard time sustaining it"

Transcript:
Speaker 1
Yeah, so this was my fourth topic, which you cruelly, you can cut my screen.

Speaker 3
I know I feel like we totally lost track of like, how do we country and then you just started like going depth first as opposed to like actually tackling the actual...

Speaker 2
Look, I will come back next to the next statement and biology go eight hours, okay? So I hope Mark went to the bathroom before this because we are going to meet the record like, art de yo, we will go both red and depth first. Eight hours and one minute. All right, it's been a new challenge.

Speaker 1
So, yeah, look, this is gonna be the thing I was gonna say. Like, look, there's a part of being creative that is individual effort and is individual effort to learn and is individual effort to try to actually create something. And then there's a big part of it. It's like, what is your personal social network? Like, who are your friends? And there's an old adage that is absolutely true, which is basically any individual over time, you basically become the average of the five people you spend the most time with. You know, you zero in, you adapt. And it's a fundamental human instinct because everybody, you know, very few people can go through life alone. You need some sort of support network. Your support network has a value system and they have things they care about and things they're interested in and you will tend to care about and be more interested in those things. And if they, if you don't have anybody around you who shares your interests, right, or has the same drives that you do, you'll have a very hard time sustaining it.

          That was the point of Epicurus’s bold assertion that good always predominates in the wise man because he never has any lack of pleasures. And that, again, is how Epicurus, like the rest, reaches the conclusion we are after, that the wise man is always happy

          “What you’ve just discovered is called ‘positive bias’,” said the boy. “You had a rule in your mind, and you kept on thinking of triplets that should make the rule say ‘Yes’. But you didn’t try to test any triplets that should make the rule say ‘No’. In fact you didn’t get a single ‘No’, so ‘any three numbers’ could have just as easily been the rule. It’s sort of like how people imagine experiments that could confirm their hypotheses instead of trying to imagine experiments that could falsify them—that’s not quite exactly the same mistake but it’s close.
