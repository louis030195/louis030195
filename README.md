          Cryptocurrency Blockchain Web Three Is Following This Exact Trajectories

Key takeaways:
- Morrison derives a threestep process for how new technologies are received by the status quo.
- Stage one is just ignoring the technology, while stage two is engaging in rational counter arguments.
- Stage three is when the name calling begins, with opponents accusing the technology of being bad for society.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
And so Morrison basically derives, he goes through this example, and he derives basically this three part process that he says applies to any new technology. Basically, as it is as it is greeted and fought by the status quo by the powers it be. And he says basically, it's a three step process. The step one is just completely ignore it. Like, so just pretend it doesn't exist, refuse to acknowledge it, don't talk about it, don't even engage in conversations like we're just not going to do this. At some point though, at some point, these things become too obvious and they have to engage. She said step two is rational counter argument, right? So, and rational counter argument is this can't possibly work because, you know, it's going to be too expensive. It's not going to be fast enough. It's not going to scale. People don't know how to use it. All the different kind of rational arguments that you can come up with to oppose something. And then ultimately, when those don't work anymore, because people are still watching this and being like, okay, this still seems like a good idea. Then he says stage three is when the name calling begins. And so stage three is basically just like a full out power status political fight where all of a sudden basically it's like, okay, these are these people who are bringing this technology, they're bad people, they have bad morals, they have bad intent, they're going to ruin everything. And if you think about it, it's so funny because it's like basically the internet followed this exact trajectory. Like, you know, crypto cryptocurrency blockchain web three is following this exact same trajectory social networking follows this exact same trajectory. Like, I've now seen this pattern, you know, out of 50 times in the last 30 years and it keeps playing out the same way. Nobody learns anything. Right. And it is this is literally what happens with every new technology and I become convinced that basically how this unfolds.

          When we are young we believe that we know everything, and so we believe that if we see no explanation for something, then no explanation exists. When we are older we realise that the whole universe works by a rhythm and a reason, even if we ourselves do not know it. It is only our own ignorance which appears to us as insanity.

          We must distinguish between, on the one hand, our subjective experiences or our feelings of conviction, which can never justify any statement (though they can be made the subject of psychological investigation) and, on the other hand, the objective logical relations subsisting among the various systems of scientific statements, and within each of them.
