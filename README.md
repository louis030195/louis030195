Hi, I'm Louis, I am a carbon-based bipedal life form descended from an üêí.
In 2022 I [made 4000 contributions on GitHub](https://github.com/louis030195), 
[read 93 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103091881-louis-beaumont), 
and [written 700,000 words on a public Obsidian](https://brain.louis030195.com).
- I also founded an AI startup that became a 5 figure business in only a few months and got into in the latest [Techstars](https://techstars.com) batch.
- In 2023, I built [An AI assistant for Obsidian](https://github.com/louis030195/obsidian-ava), aligned with my desire to reduce the friction between our physical and digital mind. This was part of [Buildspace n&ws2](https://buildspace.so).
- I also built [Solpilot](https://solpilot.xyz), [Getpilot](https://getpilot.differentai.xyz/), and now focusing on [Embedbase, which adds memory to AI with embeddings](https://github.com/different-ai/embedbase), as part of [OrangeDAO](https://orangedao.xyz) F1 fellowship.

          Why has that man fallen in love with that woman? Because she's pretty. Why does pretty matter? Because human beings are a mainly monogamous species and so males are choosy about their mates (as male chimpanzees are not); prettiness is an indication of youth and health, which are indications of fertility: Why does that man care about fertility in his mate? Because if he did not, his genes would be eclipsed by those of men who did. Why does he care about that? He does not, but his genes act as if they do. Those who choose infertile mates leave no descendants. Therefore, everybody is descended from men who preferred fertile women, and every person inherits from those ancestors the same preference.

          Cryptocurrency Blockchain Web Three Is Following This Exact Trajectories

Summary:
"I've now seen this pattern, you know, out of 50 times in the last 30 years and it keeps playing out the same way. Nobody learns anything," he says. "This is literally what happens with every new technology."

Transcript:
Speaker 1
And so Morrison basically derives, he goes through this example, and he derives basically this three part process that he says applies to any new technology. Basically, as it is as it is greeted and fought by the status quo by the powers it be. And he says basically, it's a three step process. The step one is just completely ignore it. Like, so just pretend it doesn't exist, refuse to acknowledge it, don't talk about it, don't even engage in conversations like we're just not going to do this. At some point though, at some point, these things become too obvious and they have to engage. She said step two is rational counter argument, right? So, and rational counter argument is this can't possibly work because, you know, it's going to be too expensive. It's not going to be fast enough. It's not going to scale. People don't know how to use it. All the different kind of rational arguments that you can come up with to oppose something. And then ultimately, when those don't work anymore, because people are still watching this and being like, okay, this still seems like a good idea. Then he says stage three is when the name calling begins. And so stage three is basically just like a full out power status political fight where all of a sudden basically it's like, okay, these are these people who are bringing this technology, they're bad people, they have bad morals, they have bad intent, they're going to ruin everything. And if you think about it, it's so funny because it's like basically the internet followed this exact trajectory. Like, you know, crypto cryptocurrency blockchain web three is following this exact same trajectory social networking follows this exact same trajectory. Like, I've now seen this pattern, you know, out of 50 times in the last 30 years and it keeps playing out the same way. Nobody learns anything. Right. And it is this is literally what happens with every new technology and I become convinced that basically how this unfolds.
