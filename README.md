          Cryptocurrency Blockchain Web Three Is Following This Exact Trajectories

Key takeaways:

‚Ä¢ Morrison derives a threestep process for how new technologies are received by the status quo.

‚Ä¢ Stage one is just ignoring the technology, while stage two is engaging in rational counter arguments.

‚Ä¢ Stage three is when the name calling begins, with opponents accusing the technology of being bad for society.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
And so Morrison basically derives, he goes through this example, and he derives basically this three-part process that he says applies to any new technology. Basically, as it is as it is greeted and fought by the status quo, by the powers it be. And he says, basically, it's a three-step process. The step one is just completely ignore it. Like, so just pretend it doesn't exist, refuse to acknowledge it, don't talk about it, don't even engage in conversations like we're just not going to do this. At some point though, at some point, these things become too obvious and they have to engage, he said step two is rational counter argument, right? So, and rational counter argument is this can't possibly work because it's going to be too expensive, it's not going to be fast enough, it's not going to scale, people don't know how To use it, right? All the different kind of rational arguments that you can come up with to oppose something. And then ultimately, when those don't work anymore, because people are still watching this and being like, okay, this still seems like a good idea, then he says stage three says stage Three is when the name calling begins, right? And so stage three is basically just like a full-out power status political fight where all of a sudden basically it's like, okay, these are, you know, these people who are bringing This to technology, they're bad people, they have bad morals, they have bad intent, they're going to ruin everything, right? And if you think about it, it's so funny because it's like basically the internet followed this exact trajectory, like, you know, crypto, cryptocurrency blockchain, web three is Following this exact same trajectory social networking followed this exact same trajectory. Like I've now seen this pattern, you know, out of 50 times in the last 30 years and it keeps playing out the same way. Nobody learns anything, right? And it's this is literally what happens with every new technology and I become convinced that basically how this unfolds.
