          For most people the best plan probably is to go to work for some existing company. But it is a good idea to understand what‚Äôs happening when you do this. A job means doing something people want, averaged together with everyone else in that company.

          Obvious ideas will always be executed by big companies

So the big thing is, most of the obviously good ideas are bad ideas for a startup, right? And the reason is because most of the obviously good ideas, if they're obviously good ideas, they're already getting done by big companies. So what are big companies really good at? Like, just take all the big, the top 50, whatever tech companies, what are they really good at? They're really good at doing the next obviously good idea, right? They're like, what's a good idea? Smartphone whose battery lasts 10% longer, you know? Yeah, like Apple's on it, right? You know, they got like 10,000 people working on that, right? Like, there's no startup opportunity there. And so like, you know, we always say kind of by definition, like if it's a good startup idea, it basically, it can't be a good idea that looks like a good idea because a big company's already doing that.

          Cryptocurrency Blockchain Web Three Is Following This Exact Trajectories

Key takeaways:
- Morrison derives a threestep process for how new technologies are received by the status quo.
- Stage one is just ignoring the technology, while stage two is engaging in rational counter arguments.
- Stage three is when the name calling begins, with opponents accusing the technology of being bad for society.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
And so Morrison basically derives, he goes through this example, and he derives basically this three part process that he says applies to any new technology. Basically, as it is as it is greeted and fought by the status quo by the powers it be. And he says basically, it's a three step process. The step one is just completely ignore it. Like, so just pretend it doesn't exist, refuse to acknowledge it, don't talk about it, don't even engage in conversations like we're just not going to do this. At some point though, at some point, these things become too obvious and they have to engage. She said step two is rational counter argument, right? So, and rational counter argument is this can't possibly work because, you know, it's going to be too expensive. It's not going to be fast enough. It's not going to scale. People don't know how to use it. All the different kind of rational arguments that you can come up with to oppose something. And then ultimately, when those don't work anymore, because people are still watching this and being like, okay, this still seems like a good idea. Then he says stage three is when the name calling begins. And so stage three is basically just like a full out power status political fight where all of a sudden basically it's like, okay, these are these people who are bringing this technology, they're bad people, they have bad morals, they have bad intent, they're going to ruin everything. And if you think about it, it's so funny because it's like basically the internet followed this exact trajectory. Like, you know, crypto cryptocurrency blockchain web three is following this exact same trajectory social networking follows this exact same trajectory. Like, I've now seen this pattern, you know, out of 50 times in the last 30 years and it keeps playing out the same way. Nobody learns anything. Right. And it is this is literally what happens with every new technology and I become convinced that basically how this unfolds.
