          Consistency Over Intensity

Summary:
CNN's John Sutter talks about the concept of habit stacking. He says meditation can be tied to a well-established, daily routine. One woman who wanted to meditate couldn't find time for 20 minutes every day. She was frustrated with herself and decided to give it up completely.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
There is one somebody i was working with who wanted to implement meditation, and for some reason he, or it was she, she couldn't find 20 minutes to do itike, she i just can't do 20, 20 minutes. And she's like, let me try ten minutes. And she couldn't do ten minutes. Now this woman was very startn to get frustrated with herself, because she was breaking promises to herself. And she was in give it up completely. Moka, i guess i can't meditate. And then we started talking about this concept of habit stacking, where maybe you could tie meditation to a habit that's already well established. And as she combed over her routine in the morning, she said, you knowha, i'm wan to do, i'm going to meditate while i brush my teeth.

          A relationship of peace is a relationship that is more parallel than perpendicular. It is two individuals that move side by side. Rather than two individuals that intersect. A maintenance of individuality and freedom results in the prevalence of peace.
