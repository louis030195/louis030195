          Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for. Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead of making users happy. In a startup, you‚Äôre not just trying to solve problems. You‚Äôre trying to solve problems that users care about. So I think you should make users the test, just as acquirers do. Treat a startup as an optimization problem in which performance is measured by number of users. As anyone who has tried to optimize software knows, the key is measurement. When you try to guess where your program is slow, and what would make it faster, you almost always guess wrong.

Summary:
The modern use of the word cult is, we have this very micro-deficient cult. It's like a fake new religion as compared to the all presumably real older. In the language of the ancient city, these are all cults.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah. In the language of the ancient city, these are all cults. These are all cults. The modern use of the word cult is, we have this very micro-deficient cult, which is like, whatever, basically what it's called meaning, kind of, modern parlance. It's like a fake new religion. As compared to the all presumably real older.

Speaker 2
Let me ask you a spicy question. If Mark had reason for starting a cult, what would that cult have to do and believe in? Don't you, I mean, you already have the answer.

Speaker 1
You're in it.

Speaker 3
Yeah. Yeah. Mark, I just thought you were going to say, my religion will require a sacrifice.

Speaker 1
Of course it requires a price. All religious requires a sacrifice.

Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah. Someday our daughter has to be taken away from us, like, without city. Wow.

Speaker 1
No, no, no. We have the diluted form. My version, my call is a very diluted form of what my predecessor 4000 years ago would have had.

Speaker 2
Yeah, she only has listened to Mark's podcast.

Speaker 1
But appropriately so. There we go. OK. Booktube.

Speaker 2
Booktube. The Machiavellian's by a burner. Yeah.

Speaker 1
So actually, there's two books by Burnham. I referenced the Machiavellian's is actually stronger on, it's very good on politics, political theory, political structure, political power. And I'm happy to talk about that. The other book, the managerial revolution, is actually even more relevant, I think, to the kind of world that we live in. And maybe I could touch on that one if that's OK. Yeah. Yeah.

          Lindy is a deli in New York, now a tourist trap, that proudly claims to be famous for its cheesecake, but in fact has been known for fifty or so years by physicists and mathematicians thanks to the heuristic that developed there. Actors who hung out there gossiping about other actors discovered that Broadway shows that lasted for, say, one hundred days, had a future life expectancy of a hundred more. For those that lasted two hundred days, two hundred more. The heuristic became known as the Lindy effect.
