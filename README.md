          The solution societies find, as they get more specialized, is to make the trade into a two-step process. Instead of trading violins directly for potatoes, you trade violins for, say, silver, which you can then trade again for anything else you need. The intermediate stuff‚Äîthe medium of exchange‚Äîcan be anything that‚Äôs rare and portable. Historically metals have been the most common, but recently we‚Äôve been using a medium of exchange, called the dollar, that doesn‚Äôt physically exist.

          Now this principle of induction cannot be a purely logical truth like a tautology or an analytic statement.Indeed, if there were such a thing as a purely logical principle of induction, there would be no problem of induction; for in this case, all inductive inferences would have to be regarded as purely logical or tautological transformations, just like inferences in deductive logic.

          You are the average of the five people around you 

Key takeaways:
- Creative success not only depends on individual effort but also on one's social network
- One becomes the average of the five people they spend the most time with

Transcript:
Speaker 1
Yeah, so this was my fourth topic, which you cruelly, you can cut my screen.

Speaker 3
I know I feel like we totally lost track of like, how do we country and then you just started like going depth first as opposed to like actually tackling the actual...

Speaker 2
Look, I will come back next to the next statement and biology go eight hours, okay? So I hope Mark went to the bathroom before this because we are going to meet the record like, art de yo, we will go both red and depth first. Eight hours and one minute. All right, it's been a new challenge.

Speaker 1
So, yeah, look, this is gonna be the thing I was gonna say. Like, look, there's a part of being creative that is individual effort and is individual effort to learn and is individual effort to try to actually create something. And then there's a big part of it. It's like, what is your personal social network? Like, who are your friends? And there's an old adage that is absolutely true, which is basically any individual over time, you basically become the average of the five people you spend the most time with. You know, you zero in, you adapt. And it's a fundamental human instinct because everybody, you know, very few people can go through life alone. You need some sort of support network. Your support network has a value system and they have things they care about and things they're interested in and you will tend to care about and be more interested in those things. And if they, if you don't have anybody around you who shares your interests, right, or has the same drives that you do, you'll have a very hard time sustaining it.
