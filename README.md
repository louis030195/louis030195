          Great founders thought five years or more about the problem beforehand

Summary:
The great successful companies, great founders, almost always have thought deeply about the domain they're operating in for five years or longer. And basically, you ask increasingly detailed questions. If the answers get more and more specific, as the questions get more andmore specific, that's really good. "By the way, OK, by the way, you're also trying to pull one on yourself," he adds.

You have to really understand all of the twists and turns that require getting from point A, which is like a vague idea of what you want to do, kind of all the way to point Z on the other side of the maze, which is an actual product that matters that you can build a startup around. And you have to actually think your way through all those steps. And the founders who are good at what they do, think through, they take the time they put in the effort, often years. What I find is it's almost always five years plus. This is not like a short term thing. It's almost always somebody. The great successful companies, great founders, almost always have thought deeply about the domain they're operating in for five years, up and 10 years, up and longer. And basically, you ask increasingly detailed questions. If the answers get more and more specific, as the questions get more and more specific, that's really good. If the answers get more and more in general and more and more fuzz, then it's like, OK. And by the way, OK, you're trying to pull one on us. OK, by the way, you're also trying to pull one on yourself. Yeah, right.

          Lindy is a deli in New York, now a tourist trap, that proudly claims to be famous for its cheesecake, but in fact has been known for fifty or so years by physicists and mathematicians thanks to the heuristic that developed there. Actors who hung out there gossiping about other actors discovered that Broadway shows that lasted for, say, one hundred days, had a future life expectancy of a hundred more. For those that lasted two hundred days, two hundred more. The heuristic became known as the Lindy effect.
