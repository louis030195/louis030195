Summary:
Sri Ram: Big companies are in this new model of managerial capitalism. What we do is we fund the throwbacks, such as Elon Musk and Henry Ford. He says managers don't expose themselves to risks involved in doing new things. "I think one of the world needs the bourgeois capitalist model," he says.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
You're going to need this management class. I go through all this to basically say, this then is the lens that I now provide basically for what we do in venture capital, what we do in startups, which basically, the way to think about it is the big companies, like the Fortune 500 and the big tech companies, are they are in this new model of managerial capitalism. At your point, Sri Ram, it's like, you can very clearly see that because you read the executive biographies and it's like, and you see it. It's like Harvard Business School, Stanford Business School, McKinsey, Goldman Sachs. It's like all the above administration. It's all the markers of people who have kind of been in this elite management kind of role and now they're running these companies. What we do is we fund the throwbacks. And Elon Musk, we'll just use the example. Elon's a throwback. Elon's a throwback to Henry Ford. He's a throwback to the prior era of what Burnham called bourgeois capitalism, which is basically owner, proprietor, dictator of the company. And why do we do this? It's because companies that are run in the managerial mode don't do new things. Why do they do new things? Because managers don't do new things. The whole point of being a manager is that you don't expose yourself to the kind of risks involved in doing new things. You don't just try to basically stand that control job for as long as possible. I think one of the world needs the bourgeois capitalist model and they need the entrepreneurs to actually do what they do for anything new to happen. And so we basically keep that. We keep basically the original form of capitalism alive.

          Perception is reality. It‚Äôs not about how much you increase your prospect‚Äôs likelihood of success, or decrease the time delay to achievement, or decrease their effort and sacrifice. That in itself is not valuable. Many times, they will have no idea. The Grand Slam Offer only becomes valuable once the prospect perceives the increase in likelihood of achievement, perceives the decrease in time delay, and perceives the decrease in effort and sacrifice.

Summary:
The modern use of the word cult is, we have this very micro-deficient cult. It's like a fake new religion as compared to the all presumably real older. In the language of the ancient city, these are all cults.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
Yeah, yeah. In the language of the ancient city, these are all cults. These are all cults. The modern use of the word cult is, we have this very micro-deficient cult, which is like, whatever, basically what it's called meaning, kind of, modern parlance. It's like a fake new religion. As compared to the all presumably real older.

Speaker 2
Let me ask you a spicy question. If Mark had reason for starting a cult, what would that cult have to do and believe in? Don't you, I mean, you already have the answer.

Speaker 1
You're in it.

Speaker 3
Yeah. Yeah. Mark, I just thought you were going to say, my religion will require a sacrifice.

Speaker 1
Of course it requires a price. All religious requires a sacrifice.

Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah. Someday our daughter has to be taken away from us, like, without city. Wow.

Speaker 1
No, no, no. We have the diluted form. My version, my call is a very diluted form of what my predecessor 4000 years ago would have had.

Speaker 2
Yeah, she only has listened to Mark's podcast.

Speaker 1
But appropriately so. There we go. OK. Booktube.

Speaker 2
Booktube. The Machiavellian's by a burner. Yeah.

Speaker 1
So actually, there's two books by Burnham. I referenced the Machiavellian's is actually stronger on, it's very good on politics, political theory, political structure, political power. And I'm happy to talk about that. The other book, the managerial revolution, is actually even more relevant, I think, to the kind of world that we live in. And maybe I could touch on that one if that's OK. Yeah. Yeah.
