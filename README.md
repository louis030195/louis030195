          In companies, you have a dictator at the top, a CEO, or the founders. Then all of a sudden it turns back into a butterfly network, and now you report to a board, a bunch of people. And inherently, the founder-dictators tend to be very risk-prone. They have a lot of vision, they have a lot of drive, they know where they want to take the thing. They like to make risky moves and bets and pivots and turns. But boards don‚Äôt like that. Boards don‚Äôt like to be dragged along. It‚Äôs a group of people. It‚Äôs groupthink, it‚Äôs committee-think. No committee ever built anything great. So related to that, no board ever built anything great. Boards can be helpful; they can be sounding boards. But you do not want the board to be running the company. And the larger the board, the more you‚Äôre going to find yourself spending time just keeping them up-to-date and in sync.

          Personality Traits for entrepreneurs 

Summary:
Openness equals non-discriminatory, right? Equals every new idea is a great idea. It's hard to be creative if you're not discriminatory. Great artists are picky and choosy over what they think the great ideas are. And so maybe you want like high openness, you want high low agreeability - which means high disagreeability.

It's like they're nervous system is not wired that way. And so you kind of need to close your eyes and kind of imagine, you know, what if you took somebody who was born to be a musician, for example, and you forced them to become an accountant, Right? Or vice versa, like what if you took somebody who was born to be an accountant and forced them to be a musician, right? And both people would be very, very unhappy. And so anyway, this is sort of the inherent trait of creativity, openness. So we say that, you know, that's one, you know, against the, you know, directly related one is agreeableness, right? So open plus agreeable equals every new idea is a great idea, right? Equals non-discriminatory. Well, it's hard to be creative if you're not discriminatory. Like one of the things that great artists have in common is they're like actually really picky and choosy over what they think the great ideas are and they throw away a lot of their like Initial attempts. And so maybe you want like high openness, you want high, you want actually high low agreeability, which means high disagreeability, right? So you kind of want that. Conscientiousness, you know, do artists or creators or programmers or entrepreneurs have to be conscientious? Probably yes, to some extent, right? And there's a sub-trade of conscientiousness called industriousness, which basically is like inherent work ethic, right? Sort of drive to get things done. So, you know, you probably need some of that. So, just to start with that, because, when I first heard something like consciousness, right?

          How do and should we form and change opinions? Logic tells us to avoid inconsistencies and incoherences. Language tells us to attend to how meaning is inferred from ambiguous language. Decision theory says to distinguish values from fact opinion, and says exactly how decisions should respond to these. Regarding fact opinion, Bayesian theory says to distinguish priors from likelihoods, and says exactly how fact opinion should respond to evidence.
