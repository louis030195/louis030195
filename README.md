          company culture is one in which people have something in common that distinguishes them quite sharply from the rest of the world. If everybody likes ice cream, that probably doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Ä¶ you also need to strike the right balance between athletes (competitive people) and nerds (creators) no matter what.

          Great founders thought five years or more about the problem beforehand

Summary:
The great successful companies, great founders, almost always have thought deeply about the domain they're operating in for five years or longer. And basically, you ask increasingly detailed questions. If the answers get more and more specific, as the questions get more andmore specific, that's really good. "By the way, OK, by the way, you're also trying to pull one on yourself," he adds.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
You have to really understand all of the twists and turns that require getting from point A, which is like a vague idea of what you want to do, kind of all the way to point Z on the other side Of the maze, which is an actual product that matters that you can build a startup around. And you have to actually think your way through all those steps. And the founders who are good at what they do, think through, they take the time they put in the effort, often years. What I find is it's almost always five years plus. This is not like a short term thing. It's almost always somebody. The great successful companies, great founders, almost always have thought deeply about the domain they're operating in for five years, up and 10 years, up and longer. And basically, you ask increasingly detailed questions. If the answers get more and more specific, as the questions get more and more specific, that's really good. If the answers get more and more in general and more and more fuzz, then it's like, OK. And by the way, OK, you're trying to pull one on us. OK, by the way, you're also trying to pull one on yourself. Yeah, right.

          In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy, the mass of the system must remain constant over time, as the system's mass cannot change, so quantity can neither be added nor be removed. Therefore, the quantity of mass is conserved over time.
