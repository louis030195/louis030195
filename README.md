          In marketing strategy, first-mover advantage (FMA) is the competitive advantage gained by the initial ("first-moving") significant occupant of a market segment. First-mover advantage enables a company or firm to establish strong brand recognition, customer loyalty, and early purchase of resources before other competitors enter the market segment.  First movers in a specific industry are almost always followed by competitors that attempt to capitalise on the first movers' success. These followers are also aiming to gain market share; however, most of the time the first-movers will already have an established market share, with a loyal customer base that allows them to maintain their market share.

          Personality Traits for entrepreneurs 

Summary:
Openness equals non-discriminatory, right? Equals every new idea is a great idea. It's hard to be creative if you're not discriminatory. Great artists are picky and choosy over what they think the great ideas are. And so maybe you want like high openness, you want high low agreeability - which means high disagreeability.

Speaker 1
It's like they're nervous system is not wired that way. And so you kind of need to close your eyes and kind of imagine, you know, what if you took somebody who was born to be a musician, for example, and you forced them to become an accountant, right? Or vice versa, like what if you took somebody who was born to be an accountant and forced them to be a musician, right? And both people would be very, very unhappy. And so anyway, this is sort of the inherent trait of creativity, openness. So we say that, you know, that's one, you know, against the, you know, directly related one is agreeableness, right? So open plus agreeable equals every new idea is a great idea, right? Equals non-discriminatory. Well, it's hard to be creative if you're not discriminatory. Like one of the things that great artists have in common is they're like actually really picky and choosy over what they think the great ideas are and they throw away a lot of their like initial attempts. And so maybe you want like high openness, you want high, you want actually high low agreeability, which means high disagreeability, right? So you kind of want that. Conscientiousness, you know, do artists or creators or programmers or entrepreneurs have to be conscientious? Probably yes, to some extent, right? And there's a sub-trade of conscientiousness called industriousness, which basically is like inherent work ethic, right? Sort of drive to get things done. So, you know, you probably need some of that. So, just to start with that, because, when I first heard something like consciousness, right?
