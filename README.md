Hi, I'm Louis, I am a carbon-based bipedal life form descended from an üêí.
In 2022 I [made 4000 contributions on GitHub](https://github.com/louis030195), 
[read 93 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103091881-louis-beaumont), 
and [written 700,000 words on a public Obsidian](https://brain.louis030195.com).
- I also founded an AI startup that became a 5 figure business in only a few months and got into in the latest [Techstars](https://techstars.com) batch.
- In 2023, I built [An AI assistant for Obsidian](https://github.com/louis030195/obsidian-ava), aligned with my desire to reduce the friction between our physical and digital mind. This was part of [Buildspace n&ws2](https://buildspace.so).
- I also built [Solpilot](https://solpilot.xyz), [Getpilot](https://getpilot.differentai.xyz/), and now focusing on [Embedbase, which adds memory to AI with embeddings](https://github.com/different-ai/embedbase), as part of [OrangeDAO](https://orangedao.xyz) F1 fellowship.

          Cryptocurrency Blockchain Web Three Is Following This Exact Trajectories

Summary:
"I've now seen this pattern, you know, out of 50 times in the last 30 years and it keeps playing out the same way. Nobody learns anything," he says. "This is literally what happens with every new technology."

Speaker 1
And so Morrison basically derives, he goes through this example, and he derives basically this three part process that he says applies to any new technology. Basically, as it is as it is greeted and fought by the status quo by the powers it be. And he says basically, it's a three step process. The step one is just completely ignore it. Like, so just pretend it doesn't exist, refuse to acknowledge it, don't talk about it, don't even engage in conversations like we're just not going to do this. At some point though, at some point, these things become too obvious and they have to engage. She said step two is rational counter argument, right? So, and rational counter argument is this can't possibly work because, you know, it's going to be too expensive. It's not going to be fast enough. It's not going to scale. People don't know how to use it. All the different kind of rational arguments that you can come up with to oppose something. And then ultimately, when those don't work anymore, because people are still watching this and being like, okay, this still seems like a good idea. Then he says stage three is when the name calling begins. And so stage three is basically just like a full out power status political fight where all of a sudden basically it's like, okay, these are these people who are bringing this technology, they're bad people, they have bad morals, they have bad intent, they're going to ruin everything. And if you think about it, it's so funny because it's like basically the internet followed this exact trajectory. Like, you know, crypto cryptocurrency blockchain web three is following this exact same trajectory social networking follows this exact same trajectory. Like, I've now seen this pattern, you know, out of 50 times in the last 30 years and it keeps playing out the same way. Nobody learns anything. Right. And it is this is literally what happens with every new technology and I become convinced that basically how this unfolds.

          Only technical individuals innovate

Summary:
Sri Ram: Big companies are in this new model of managerial capitalism. What we do is we fund the throwbacks, such as Elon Musk and Henry Ford. He says managers don't expose themselves to risks involved in doing new things. "I think one of the world needs the bourgeois capitalist model," he says.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
You're going to need this management class. I go through all this to basically say, this then is the lens that I now provide basically for what we do in venture capital, what we do in startups, which basically, the way to think about it is the big companies, like the Fortune 500 and the big tech companies, are they are in this new model of managerial capitalism. At your point, Sri Ram, it's like, you can very clearly see that because you read the executive biographies and it's like, and you see it. It's like Harvard Business School, Stanford Business School, McKinsey, Goldman Sachs. It's like all the above administration. It's all the markers of people who have kind of been in this elite management kind of role and now they're running these companies. What we do is we fund the throwbacks. And Elon Musk, we'll just use the example. Elon's a throwback. Elon's a throwback to Henry Ford. He's a throwback to the prior era of what Burnham called bourgeois capitalism, which is basically owner, proprietor, dictator of the company. And why do we do this? It's because companies that are run in the managerial mode don't do new things. Why do they do new things? Because managers don't do new things. The whole point of being a manager is that you don't expose yourself to the kind of risks involved in doing new things. You don't just try to basically stand that control job for as long as possible. I think one of the world needs the bourgeois capitalist model and they need the entrepreneurs to actually do what they do for anything new to happen. And so we basically keep that. We keep basically the original form of capitalism alive.
